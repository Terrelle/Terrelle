### Hi there, I'm Terrelle! ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Terrelle/Terrelle** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

I am a Computer Science student at Kent State University.


- ðŸŒ± This past summer, I was a [MLH Production Engineer Fellow at Meta](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/site-reliability-engineering) where I worked on an open-source project using Linux, Containers, Scripting, Testing, CI/CD. It also served as an amazing opportunity to polish my monitoring, and troubleshooting skills.



- âš¡ Fun fact: As a personal development enthusiast, I created a self-development community called [GenZbuzz](https://thegenzbuzz.com/) during my freshman year of college, which is now a community of over 130,000 members across social platforms.
